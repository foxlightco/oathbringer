I pledge to use coding and security to make a positive influence.

My actions will not compromise privacy, nor help anyone else do so.

I will balance privileged access with transparency and accountability. 

I will not excuse bad faith actions no matter how justified the reason.

I will report malicious and abusive behavior no matter the perpetrator.
