# Quick Start
- [Read the oath](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/blob/master/oath.txt)
- [Sign your name](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/edit/master/committers.md)

## Impetus
Computer scientists, programmers and security researchers are entrusted with tremendous access and responsibility, while being faced with hard choices and tempting incentives: 

- [to mis-use user data](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/06/spokeo-pay-800000-settle-ftc-charges-company-allegedly-marketed)
- [to abuse privileges for personal gain](http://www.mercercountyprosecutor.com/press/Motor%20Vehicle.pdf)
- [to build spying tools](http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/category/corporate-enemies/)

[This oath](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/blob/master/oath.txt) is a public way for people to [state their commitment to ethical conduct](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/edit/master/committers.md), and open up discussion for what ethical behavior means in the context of software engineering

## Inspiration
The [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#Modern_version) for medical professionals

The publication ["A Scientist Rebels](http://lanl-the-back-story.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-scientist-rebels.html) by MIT researcher [Norbert Weiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener)in response to the US military attempting to weaponize his research
